 * There are only two days at the beginning of the period , where all worker are present.
 * Using zero indexing for employees, employees 1 and 2 are absent on the third day, and employee 2 is also out on the forth and fifth days.
 * The maximum streak occurs at the beginning and is 2 days long.
 *
 * Function Description Complete the maxStrak function in the editor below. The function must return an integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive days where all the employees of the project are present.
 *
 * maxStreak has the following parameters: m: an integer denoting the number of employees working on the project. data: an array of n strings, where the value of each element data[i] is a string where data[i][j] denotes the j-th employee is present on the i-th day.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * 1 <= m <= 10
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 100000
 *
 * Each data[i][j] belongs {"Y", "N"}
 *
 * Sample Input 0:
 * 2
 * 2
 * YN
 * NN
 * Sample Output 0:
 * 0
 *
 * Sample Input 1:
 * 3
 * 1
 * NYY
 * Sample output 1:
 * 0
